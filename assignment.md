# First Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around exploratory data
analysis techniques and presentation of results to a stakeholder.

**Once you start working please follow the [workflow](./workflow.md) to help you achieve the tasks successfully!**

# The data

- You will use the King County Housing Data: This dataset contains information about home sales in King County (USA). Please download<br> the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) and add it to the ```data ``` folder.
- The dataset will be provide, please copy it in the data folder where it will not be uploaded to github.
- The description of the column names can be found in the `column_names.md` file.
- The column names may NOT be clear at times:

  _In the real world we will run into similar challenges. We would then go ask our business stakeholders for more information. In<br> this case, let us assume our business stakeholder who would give us information, left the company. Meaning we would have to <br>identify and look up what each column names might actually mean. (google is your friend ;) )_

# The Tasks

1. Create a new repo using this template.

2. Through EDA/statistical analysis above please come up with **AT LEAST 3 insights** regarding the overall data. One should be<br> geographical.

3. In addition also come up with **AT LEAST 3 recommendations** for your stakeholder.

_Note, you can take either the perspective of a buyer or a seller. Choose a stakeholder from the list at the end of this file._

# The Deliverables

0. **New repository** from this template or extend this repository adding your analysis.
1. A **well documented Jupyter Notebook** (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ekami66/detailed-exploratory-data-analysis-with-python)<br> for an example) containing the code you've written for this project and comments explaining it. This work will need to be pushed to your<br> GitHub repository in order to submit your project. Do not push all the analysis... just the analysis that is relevant! You can start<br> with the [starter notebook](EDA.ipynb).
2. An **updated and organized README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file<br> should be the source of information for navigating through the repository. Also add ```.gitignore``` and ```requirements.txt```files with<br> all the packages used , so that its easy for others to use.
3. A **short Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides/Jupyter slides presentation** giving a **high-level overview** of your methodology and<br> recommendations for **non-technical stakeholders**. The duration of the presentation should be **10 minutes**, then the discussion<br> will continue for 5 minutes. Also put your slides (delivered as a PDF export) on Github to get a well-rounded project. **Do not present using your jupyter notebook!**

# The Stakeholders

- Please chose a stakeholder.

_Note: As these stakeholders are made up (any resemblance to present people is absolutely random), please make assumptions about<br> answers they would give to your questions. (i.e. How do you define a rich neighborhood? take the zipcodes with most houses in upper<br> 10% percentile..). Whatever assumptions you make, please write them explicitly in your presentation and notebook._
