# First EDA Project
I used a Template ([assignment.md](./assignment.md) and [column_names.md](./column_names.md).) from Greenbootcamps during my further education as a Data Analyst.<br>For this project I did some basic EDA on the King County Housing Data from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) and followed the [workflow.md](./workflow.md).<br>With my analysis I really just focused on the given exercise, proof my hypotheses and come up with a recommendation.

## Requirements
- pyenv
- python==3.11.3

## Images
For some of my plots I used ```plotly```. I gave you a note with the images name in each code cell. You can find them in the images folder.
